# Google Lens Demo

This project is a React and Capacitor implementation that replicates the Google mobile interface with Google Lens functionality.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

\`\`\`
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── pages/           # Full-page components for different screens
├── services/        # Service classes for camera, API calls, etc.
├── utils/           # Utility functions
├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
├── App.tsx          # Main application component
└── index.tsx        # Entry point
\`\`\`

### Key Components

- **App.tsx**: Main application component that handles navigation between pages
- **components/**: Contains reusable UI components like StatusBar, SearchBar, etc.
- **pages/**: Contains full-page components for different screens:
  - `HomePage`: The main Google search page
  - `SearchPage`: The search results page
  - `AccountPage`: The Google account popup
  - `VoicePage`: The voice search interface
  - `LensPage`: The Google Lens camera interface

### Services

- **CameraService**: Handles camera access, photo capture, and flash control
- **ImageProcessingService**: Provides utilities for image analysis and processing
- **LensAPIService**: Handles communication with mock Google Lens API endpoints

### Utils

- **imageProcessing.ts**: Contains functions for image manipulation and analysis
- **permissions.ts**: Handles device permission requests and checks

## Features

- Dark theme UI matching Google's mobile interface
- Camera access for Google Lens functionality
- Photo capture and analysis
- Multiple lens modes (Translate, Search, Homework)
- Flash toggle functionality
- Thumbnail preview of captured images

## Implementation Details

### Google Lens Page

The Google Lens page (`LensPage.tsx`) implements a camera interface that allows users to:

1. Access their device camera
2. Take photos of objects, text, or scenes
3. Analyze the content using different modes (Translate, Search, Homework)
4. Toggle the device flash
5. View thumbnails of captured images

The camera interface includes visual elements like focus brackets to help users frame their shots properly.

### Navigation Flow

The app uses a simple state-based navigation system:

- From the home screen, clicking the lens icon in the search bar opens the Google Lens camera
- The back button in the Lens interface returns to the home screen
- Different modes can be selected using the buttons at the bottom of the screen

### Camera Permissions

The app handles camera permissions gracefully:
- Requests camera access when the Lens page is opened
- Shows an error message if permissions are denied
- Provides clear instructions on how to enable permissions

## Getting Started

Follow the setup instructions in the main README to install dependencies and run the project.

To use the Google Lens functionality:

1. Click on the lens icon in the search bar
2. Grant camera permissions when prompted
3. Point your camera at an object, text, or scene
4. Use the shutter button to capture an image
5. Select a mode (Translate, Search, Homework) to analyze the image
